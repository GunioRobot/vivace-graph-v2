A free competitor to Franz's AllegroGraph by Kevin Raison.

At the moment, this code is in a state of rapid flux.  Please don't expect
it to behave consistently from one check-in to another.

The goal is to build a fast, robust, distributed graph database with optional
RDF semantics built-in.  The primary query language is Prolog (based on PAIP),
but I have plans to add Javascript and maybe Sparql at a later date.  
At the moment, persistence is achieved via a call to (dump-triples);  this is going
to change very soon.  I am working on a native SBCL memory mapped persistence
library that will give me some variation on btrees and hashes.  When this is
complete, triples wil be persistent by default.

The code checked-in as of 2010/11/08 works fairly well, but should be
considered alpha quality.  In order to get it working, you will need the
following:
